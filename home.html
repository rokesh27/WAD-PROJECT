					<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
					<p>In the heart of every child is a hunger for home. Not just for food and a place to sleep, but for safety and community. Most importantly: for love. At the Good Shepherd Agricultural Mission, 350kms east of Delhi in the town of Banbasa, we are much more than a home for children from difficult and desperate circumstances.

                   We are a family, where love guides us all as we grow and expand year after year. Not just a regular children’s home, we are a nearly self-sustaining organization; a working farm, a vibrant school, receiving no government assistance of any kind. Take a look around and if you have any questions just get in contact with us via the menu above!</p>
