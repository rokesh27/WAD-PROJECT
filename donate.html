<p>We are so fortunate to be able to pay all of our own administration fee’s, salaries and similar costs through independent funding programs such as our school, workshop, farm and, occasionally, by donations specifically given by family and friends specifically for these expenses.</p>

We have always worked hard to accurately account for and report the financial position of our organization. We have a culture of accountability and integrity and are committed to doing the right thing. Many organizations choose to only present their Annual Reports to the public for viewing but in the spirit of full disclosure we have chosen to make available our Audited Financial Reports as well as regular declaration of our Foreign Contribution intake. For those who do not know the Financial Year in India is from April 1st to March 31st each year.</p><p>If you would like further information our Audited Reports and Annual Reports can be viewed via the button below.</p><a href="finrep.html"><button>FINANCIAL REPORTS</button></a>  </div>
